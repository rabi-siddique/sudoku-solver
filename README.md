## Sudoku Solver

This is a simple web application that allows you to solve a Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm. The goal of this application is to help you visualize how the backtracking algorithm works to solve the puzzle. The puzzle is displayed as a 9x9 grid, with some cells already filled in with numbers.

The application uses vanilla JavaScript to create the grid and solve the puzzle. When the "Solve" button is clicked, the algorithm tries to fill in the remaining cells with numbers that satisfy the rules of Sudoku. The algorithm uses a recursive backtracking approach to try out different numbers until a solution is found.

The number of recursive calls is displayed in real-time as the algorithm runs. The cells are also visually updated on the screen to show the backtracking and solved cells.

The "Reset" button simply refreshes the page to start a new puzzle. The application also features a slider that allows you to control the speed at which the algorithm run.
